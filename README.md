# Intro
--------
This repo is the official implementation of **An Input-Agnostic Hierarchical Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Fingerprinting (USENIX Security '23)**. We provide code and datasets here.

It provides a simple but effective method for trace classification.


## Requirements
python version >= 3.6

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

* code:      
  list the source codes
* dataset:
  list the datasets

```
cd code
python3 main.py
```

Details see [code README](code/README.md).
