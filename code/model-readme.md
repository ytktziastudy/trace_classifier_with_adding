In the model.py script, the Net class typically defines the architecture of the neural network model used for processing and classifying data, such as traffic fingerprinting or other related tasks.
    
list function in model.py
* **__init__**
  -----
  This method sets up the neural network architecture based on the provided configurations. It defines the sequential layers and any specific initializations needed for weights or other parameters.
  
* **gen_layers** 
  -------------
  Dynamically generates the layers of the neural network based on a list of configurations. Each configuration specifies the layer type, its dimensions, and any other parameters needed for its construction. <br>

* **flow_feature_generator**
  ------------------
  Processes flow-level data to extract or enhance features. This function is specifically designed to handle data at the flow level within network traffic, optimizing feature representation for further processing..
  
* **trace_feature_generator**
  ------------------
  Similar to flow_feature_generator, but operates on traces, which are higher-level structures comprising multiple flows. It aggregates or enhances features across flows to represent the entire trace effectively.

* **seq_2_vector**
  ------------
  Converts sequences of data points (e.g., a series of packets within a flow) into a fixed-length vector. This is essential for processing variable-length sequences with a neural network.
  
  
* **forward**
  ------------------
  The primary forward pass method that processes input data through the model's layers. It defines how data flows from the input layer to the output layer, producing predictions.

* **forward1**
  ------------------
  An alternative forward pass method that might be used for a specific processing pathway or experimental model configuration.

* **forward2**
  ------------------
  Another variant of the forward method, potentially for a different model architecture or to explore various data processing strategies within the neural network.

## Related Functions

* **get_last_layer**
  ------------------
  Retrieves the output of the last layer of the neural network, which can be useful for certain types of analysis or for connecting the model to additional components (e.g., for transfer learning).

* **data_enhancement**
  ------------------
  Applies data augmentation techniques to the input data to enhance the model's generalization capability. This could include operations like noise injection, data scaling, or other transformations.

* **rand_seq_keep_list_add**
  ------------------
  Randomly modifies a sequence based on a probability (keep_prob), typically used for data augmentation or regularization by adding randomness to the input data.

## Model Training Process Functions

* **my_train**
  ------------------
  Conducts the training process for the neural network, iterating over batches of data, updating model weights based on loss gradients, and optionally validating the model's performance using a validation dataset..

* **mytest**
  ------------------
  Evaluates the trained model's performance on a test dataset, typically measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to assess the model's effectiveness.

* **start_train**
  ------------------
  Initiates the training and evaluation cycle, possibly incorporating cross-validation. This function orchestrates the training process by calling my_train, evaluates the model with mytest, and manages any fold-specific adjustments required for k-fold cross-validation.
