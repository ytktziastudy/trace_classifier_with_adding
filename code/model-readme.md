In the model.py script, the Net class typically defines the architecture of the neural network model used for processing and classifying data, such as traffic fingerprinting or other related tasks.
    
list function in model.py
* **__init__**
  -----
  This method sets up the neural network architecture based on the provided configurations. It defines the sequential layers and any specific initializations needed for weights or other parameters.
  
* **gen_layers** 
  -------------
   Performs a single fold of k-fold cross-validation. This function is responsible for dividing the dataset into training, validation,and test sets for one specific fold, training the model on this fold, and evaluating its performance <br>

* **flow_feature_generator**
  ------------------
  Loads the dataset from the specified source and preprocesses it according to the requirements of the model. It converts raw data into a format suitable for     training and evaluation, including feature extraction and normalization.
  
* **seq_2_vector**
  ------------
  Executes the training and evaluation process using a single fold, i.e., without performing k-fold cross-validation. This is useful for quick testing or when the dataset is too small to be divided into multiple folds
  
* **trace_feature_generator**
  ------------------
  Orchestrates the k-fold cross-validation process by calling one_of_k_fold_test for each fold. It ensures that every data point is used for both training and validation exactly once, providing a robust estimate of the model's performance.
  
* **forward**
  ------------------
  This method processes the input data through each layer of the network, applying the appropriate activation functions. The final output is the model's prediction, ready for comparison against true labels in a training scenario or for direct interpretation in an inference scenario.

* **forward1**
  ------------------
  Facilitates a complete round of training and evaluation without dividing the dataset. It preprocesses the data, trains the model on the entire training set, and evaluates it on the whole validation set. This function is suitable for initial model assessments or when cross-validation is not required.

* **forward2**
  ------------------
  Facilitates a complete round of training and evaluation without dividing the dataset. It preprocesses the data, trains the model on the entire training set, and evaluates it on the whole validation set. This function is suitable for initial model assessments or when cross-validation is not required.

* **get_last_layer**
  ------------------
  Facilitates a complete round of training and evaluation without dividing the dataset. It preprocesses the data, trains the model on the entire training set, and evaluates it on the whole validation set. This function is suitable for initial model assessments or when cross-validation is not required.

* **data_enhancement**
  ------------------
  Facilitates a complete round of training and evaluation without dividing the dataset. It preprocesses the data, trains the model on the entire training set, and evaluates it on the whole validation set. This function is suitable for initial model assessments or when cross-validation is not required.

* **rand_seq_keep_list_add**
  ------------------
  Facilitates a complete round of training and evaluation without dividing the dataset. It preprocesses the data, trains the model on the entire training set, and evaluates it on the whole validation set. This function is suitable for initial model assessments or when cross-validation is not required.

* **my_train**
  ------------------
  Facilitates a complete round of training and evaluation without dividing the dataset. It preprocesses the data, trains the model on the entire training set, and evaluates it on the whole validation set. This function is suitable for initial model assessments or when cross-validation is not required.

* **mytest**
  ------------------
  Facilitates a complete round of training and evaluation without dividing the dataset. It preprocesses the data, trains the model on the entire training set, and evaluates it on the whole validation set. This function is suitable for initial model assessments or when cross-validation is not required.

* **start_train**
  ------------------
  Facilitates a complete round of training and evaluation without dividing the dataset. It preprocesses the data, trains the model on the entire training set, and evaluates it on the whole validation set. This function is suitable for initial model assessments or when cross-validation is not required.
